**About the game.**<br>
Minesweeper is a single player game. The objective of the game is to clear the grid without clicking on the bombs that have been hidden,
with hints that show you how many bombs there are next to the cell.

**Why did i make this?**<br>
Creating the project was the first 'introduction' assignment after the summer holidays in my third year. <br>
This is an example of one of the many following assignments to make me familiar with the projects companies could give me when applying for an intership.

**What did i learn?**<br>
Minesweeper is a good example of a game that uses a flood fill algorithm. <br>
Using this algorithm made me learn about how you could use them in a lot of other things. <br>
I also learned a few new tricks and functions that the P5 library uses that i can use in future projects aswell.
